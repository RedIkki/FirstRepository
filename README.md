FirstRepository
===============

First repository ever, this will be used indeed to learn how to use git :P

//Hi, :P
//I'm doing this motivated by the numbers of people I know that uses Git in some way, either it's a personal project or a bussiness
//thing. So I think it'll be a good thing to at least get started with and know the basics. So you probably won't find anything interesting
//over here, maybe just some codes I'm planning to "push" for tests, but probably nothing more then that. :P
